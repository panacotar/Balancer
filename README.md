Notes on Fly.io:
- The free plan allows only 3 machines tops. Here is how the default configuration looked for Balancer on fly.io
- - There are 3 apps (balancer, db, builder - used for deploys)
- - Each of them is on a different machine, balancer used 2 machines by default
- - In total, 4 machines (2x balancer, 1x db, 1x builder), which is bigger than the minimum for this free tier
- - I modified the number of machines for the main app (balancer) to 1
- - fly scale count 1 (CLI to modify the # of machines)

- An alternative to this would be to do some steps after deployment (maybe a bash script):
- - Remove the builder app with its machine
- - Clone one machine of the balancer app (so now you can have two machines to power it) 

To remove an app
fly apps destroy <APPNAME>

To remove a machine
fly m remove <MACHINE_ID>

To clone a machine
fly m clone <MACHINE_ID>

For the CLI:
- Run a rails command on the app's console
fly ssh console --pty -C '/rails/bin/rails console'
